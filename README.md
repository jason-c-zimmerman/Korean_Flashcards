TODO:
-----
create 'question' field in dictionary. have these questions correspond to the examples in the book.
update quiz to ask a certain number of questions. have those questions populate from the new question field in the dictionary.
have scripts iterate through a complete list of exaples randomly so all examples are presented

feature ideas:
--------------
play sound asynchronously
implement getopts
add color and graphics
add option to iterate over dictionary items in order (rather than random)
